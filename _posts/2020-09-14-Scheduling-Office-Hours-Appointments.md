title: "Scheduling private appointments for Office Hours"
---

A student asks:

> Can you show me how to schedule a private appointment with you using Canvas? 
>
> When I click "Office Hours â€“ Scheduled Appointments" in the Canvas course, it leads to a Zoom meeting that keeps me waiting forever. I'm not sure what to do next.

## Scheduling an appointment

To sign up for an appointment in Canvas:
1. Click **Calendar** in the global navigation on the far left of the screen to view the calendar.
2. Click the **Find Appointment**  button on the right-hand side of the Calendar. The Calendar will show you the available appointment slots.
3. Click an appointment slot and choose **Reserve**.

For a detailed walkthrough with screenshots, see [How do I sign up for a Scheduler appointment in the Calendar?](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Student-Guide/How-do-I-sign-up-for-a-Scheduler-appointment-in-the-Calendar/ta-p/536)

## Then what does the "Office Hours - Scheduled Appointments" link do?

**Office Hours - Scheduled Appointments** is what click to enter the meeting at the scheduled time. You'll enter a Zoom waiting room. This ensures that our appointment is private by allowig me to admit only one student at a time.
